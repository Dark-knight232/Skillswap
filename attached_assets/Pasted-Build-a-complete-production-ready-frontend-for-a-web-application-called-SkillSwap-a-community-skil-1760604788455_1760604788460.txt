Build a complete, production-ready frontend for a web application called SkillSwap, a community skill exchange platform. The frontend must be purely React-based (no backend code) and fully functional so that a backend developer can just add APIs later. Do not leave any placeholder comments that reveal AI usage. The design should be highly professional, modern, and polished, with a black-and-white theme and excellent UX/UI.
